# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical error handling issues in the reports functionality, specifically the runtime error where undefined values cause the application to crash when trying to access string methods like `.charAt()`. The system needs robust error handling to prevent crashes and provide meaningful feedback when data is incomplete or missing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the reports page to handle missing or undefined data gracefully, so that I can always access the reports without encountering runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sale record has undefined seller_email THEN the system SHALL display a fallback value instead of crashing
2. WHEN any string field is undefined or null THEN the system SHALL provide a safe default before calling string methods
3. WHEN data is missing from the database THEN the system SHALL show appropriate placeholder text
4. WHEN the reports page loads with incomplete data THEN the system SHALL still render successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see clear indicators when data is missing or incomplete, so that I can understand the quality of the information being displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN seller information is missing THEN the system SHALL display "Usuario desconocido" or similar placeholder
2. WHEN email data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show a generic avatar with "?" instead of the first letter
3. WHEN any critical field is missing THEN the system SHALL log the issue for debugging purposes
4. WHEN displaying incomplete records THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the missing information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error boundaries and null checks throughout the reports system, so that the application remains stable even with unexpected data states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any string property THEN the system SHALL verify it exists before calling string methods
2. WHEN rendering user avatars THEN the system SHALL safely handle undefined email addresses
3. WHEN processing sales data THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields before rendering
4. WHEN encountering null or undefined values THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults and continue execution
