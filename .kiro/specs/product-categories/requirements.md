# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables administrators to create and manage new "Marca" (Brand) and "Tipo" (Type) categories that can be associated with products. This categorization system will improve product organization in the database and provide better filtering and listing capabilities for both administrators and sellers in the MiniMarket Pro system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create new brands (marcas), so that I can categorize products by their manufacturer or brand name for better organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the brand management interface THEN the system SHALL display a form to create new brands
2. WHEN an administrator enters a brand name THEN the system SHALL validate that the name is not empty and is unique
3. WHEN an administrator submits a valid brand name THEN the system SHALL save the brand to the database and display a success message
4. WHEN an administrator attempts to create a brand with a duplicate name THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent creation
5. WHEN a brand is successfully created THEN the system SHALL make it immediately available for product association

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create new product types (tipos), so that I can categorize products by their category or classification for improved inventory management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the type management interface THEN the system SHALL display a form to create new types
2. WHEN an administrator enters a type name THEN the system SHALL validate that the name is not empty and is unique
3. WHEN an administrator submits a valid type name THEN the system SHALL save the type to the database and display a success message
4. WHEN an administrator attempts to create a type with a duplicate name THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent creation
5. WHEN a type is successfully created THEN the system SHALL make it immediately available for product association

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view all existing brands and types, so that I can manage and review the current categorization options available in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the brand management section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all existing brands
2. WHEN an administrator accesses the type management section THEN the system SHALL display a list of all existing types
3. WHEN displaying brands or types THEN the system SHALL show the name and creation date for each item
4. WHEN no brands or types exist THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
5. WHEN brands or types are listed THEN the system SHALL display them in alphabetical order

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to edit existing brands and types, so that I can correct mistakes or update categorization names as business needs change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator clicks edit on a brand or type THEN the system SHALL display an editable form with the current name
2. WHEN an administrator updates a brand or type name THEN the system SHALL validate uniqueness and non-empty values
3. WHEN an administrator saves valid changes THEN the system SHALL update the database and display a success message
4. WHEN an administrator attempts to save a duplicate name THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent the update
5. WHEN a brand or type is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing product associations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to delete unused brands and types, so that I can keep the categorization system clean and remove obsolete categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator attempts to delete a brand or type THEN the system SHALL check if it's associated with any products
2. WHEN a brand or type has no associated products THEN the system SHALL allow deletion after confirmation
3. WHEN a brand or type has associated products THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and display an informative error message
4. WHEN an administrator confirms deletion of an unused brand or type THEN the system SHALL remove it from the database permanently
5. WHEN deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message and update the list view

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator or seller, I want to see products organized by brands and types, so that I can quickly find and manage products within specific categories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the product list THEN the system SHALL display brand and type information for each product
2. WHEN filtering products THEN the system SHALL provide options to filter by specific brands and types
3. WHEN a brand or type filter is applied THEN the system SHALL show only products associated with the selected category
